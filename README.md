# React.JS Weather Component

## Code Challenge Question 
Create a React Component that fetches from the [Open Weather Map API](https://openweathermap.org/api) and displays the weather for any city that the user searches for.

## Details
This should be a straightforward task for someone familiar with React and building web components.  The major pieces of functionality are...
* A component that provides the form input and search button
* Logic that takes the search text and sends it to the API for lookup
* A UI widget that represents the weather data returned from the search API

You will need to create an account and use and API key that is generated for you. The API version 2.5 allows general search text (for a city name) to be given as input.
